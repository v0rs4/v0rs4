### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a seasoned software engineer with a passion for coding that has spanned over two decades. Starting with Pascal, C/C++, I quickly transitioned to PHP and JavaScript, establishing a strong foundation in web development.

I have used all major front-end frameworks, with React becoming my framework of choice. I have also used languages like Golang, Elixir, and Python, Ruby and their respective frameworks.

Over the course of the past ten years I have worked on frontend, backend, and full-stack projects, as well as mobile applications. I have also worked on a number of DevOps projects, including CI/CD pipelines, infrastructure as code, and container orchestration.

With over a decade of professional experience under my belt, I consistently deliver high-quality solutions to complex problems. Proficient in DevOps practices, I leverage tools like Kubernetes and Terraform to orchestrate deployments in leading cloud platforms such as AWS and DigitalOcean.
